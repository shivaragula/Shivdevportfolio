# Manual GitHub Repository Creation Guide

If you prefer to create repositories manually or the script doesn't work, follow these steps:

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **GitHub CLI** (Recommended): Install from https://cli.github.com/
2. **Git**: Make sure git is installed on your system
3. **GitHub Account**: Logged into https://github.com/shivaragula

## üìã Repositories to Create

1. `ecommerce-analytics`
2. `smart-task-manager`
3. `sentiment-analysis`
4. `finance-tracker`
5. `ai-cms`
6. `collaboration-platform`
7. `smart-home-dashboard`
8. `blockchain-supply-chain`
9. `ml-deployment-platform`
10. `weather-ml-model`
11. `collaborative-whiteboard`
12. `realtime-dashboard`

## üöÄ Method 1: Using GitHub CLI (Fastest)

```bash
# Login to GitHub CLI (one time setup)
gh auth login

# For each repository, run these commands:
cd github-repos/[REPO_NAME]
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add [REPO_NAME] project"
gh repo create shivaragula/[REPO_NAME] --public --source=. --push
```

## üåê Method 2: Using GitHub Web Interface

For each repository:

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit https://github.com/new
2. **Repository Name**: Enter the repository name (e.g., `ecommerce-analytics`)
3. **Description**: Copy the first line from the README.md (without the #)
4. **Visibility**: Select "Public"
5. **Initialize**: Don't initialize with README (we have our own)
6. **Click**: "Create repository"

Then in your terminal:
```bash
cd github-repos/[REPO_NAME]
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add [REPO_NAME] project"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/shivaragula/[REPO_NAME].git
git push -u origin main
```

## üîß Method 3: Batch Creation Script

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can run the provided script:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x create-github-repos.sh

# Run the script
./create-github-repos.sh
```
